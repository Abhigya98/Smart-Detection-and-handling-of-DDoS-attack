# Smart-Detection-and-handling-of-DDoS-attack

The present era depends entirely on the Internet which serves as a global source of knowledge for all users. Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attack is a malicious attempt which sabotages a targeted website, device or network's usual traffic by flooding the target or its surrounding infrastructure with Internet traffic causing damage to network stability. This work focuses on the development of an algorithm to detect a DDoS attack with all forms of TCP flag floods used to overload the server. Since DDoS attacks can cripple the internet infrastructure and resource availability to a great extent, this work also includes designing an algorithm to counteract all the malicious IP addresses that flood the internet. It ensures smooth communication and no denial of services to clients in a network. It blocks the unwanted IP addresses, keeping the system safe from service request overflow due to DDOS attacks.
